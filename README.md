# ShoeboxFamilyPhotos
A project to program a self-hosted photo sharing site for the front and back of all the photos in Grandma's shoebox of pictures.

Photos you add to Shoebox Family Photos are for your family's legacy. Remember that day? Grandma does! So record her memories with the picture! Put the picture up on the TV and hit the record button to associate the recorded audio with the picture being viewed. We'll transcribe the audio and make everything searchable. How exactly was Nana related to Uncle Charlie? Add him to the family tree! Oh, he wasn't "really" an uncle? That's OK! The tree can still record that relationship!

Features to include:
 * Add accounts for all family members. Everyone can add their own photos and view each other's.
 * Identifying people in pictures and associating them with a family tree or kinship chart
 * Store the front and back of scanned photos together to preserve hand written notes
 * Adding event names to photos to organize them ("Tiyamike's 14th Birthday", "Julie and Chen's Wedding")
 * Import from FB, Google Photos, etc
 * Federated login (Google, FB, Twitter, MS, etc) so you don't have to manage user data or handle forgotten passwords
 * Extract data from pics, add new data or modify
 * manage history of changes
 * Sort photos by timeline, map, people, event and more
 * Export full archive
