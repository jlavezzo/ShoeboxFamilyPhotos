# ShoeboxFamilyPhotos
A project to program a self-hosted photo sharing site for the front and back of all the photos in Grandma's shoebox of pictures.

Features to include:
 * Add accounts for all family members. Everyone can add their own photos and view each others.
 * Identifying people in pictures and associating them with a family tree or kinship chart
 * Store the front and back of scanned photos together to preserve hand written notes
 * Adding event names to photos to organize them ("Tiyamike's 14th Birthday", "Julie and Chen's Wedding")
 * Import from FB, Google Photos, etc
 * Federated login (Google, FB, Twitter, MS, etc) so you don't have to manage user data or handle forgotten passwords
 * Extract data from pics, add new data or modify
 * manage history of changes
 * Sort photos by timeline, map, people, event and more
 * Export full archive
